# Bankruptcy-Prediction-capsone-project
Bankruptcy prediction is an important for modern economies because early warnings of bankrupt help not only the investor but also public policy makers to take proactive steps to minimize the impact of bankruptcies.


2. Business Objective:
Build a ML model to predict wether the polish company will go bankrupt or not
so we can provide early warning to business and investors.
3. Approach:
a. Defining the objective of the problem statement.
b. Understanding the dataset.
c. Exploring the dataset and doing initial analysis.
d. Performing double classification on the dataset to predict.
e. Model evaluation and fine tuning to get better results.
4. Conclusions:
We find that two different Machine Learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) produce accurate predictions of whether a firm will
go bankrupt within the next 30, 90, or 180 days, using financial ratios as input features. The
XGBoost based models perform exceptionally well, with 99% out-of-sample accuracy. Our
training dataset uses a large database of public US firms over a period of 2000-2013. This
study has used a substantially larger training dataset as compared to previous studies.
